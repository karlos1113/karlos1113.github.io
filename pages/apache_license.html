                    <p>Apache License는 아파치 재단에서 만들어진 관대한 오픈소스 소프트웨어 라이선스이다. 다른 라이선스와 같이 유저들이 소스를 수정하거나 재배포, 자유로운 사용이 가능하지만 copyright가 보존이 된다. 아파치 재단의 프로젝트는 모두 Apache License가 적용된다.</p><br>

                    <p>보통 copyright에 의해 소스의 자유로운 사용, 수정 및 재배포는 금지되지만 그 소스나 프로젝트의 rights-holder가 유저에게 rights를 줌으로써 이러한 제한을 없앨 수 있다. 유저가 원래의 right를 받음으로써 자유로운 소스 수정 및 재배포 또는 판매까지 가능하다.</p><br>

                    <p> 단, 원래 라이선스에다가 자신이 어떤것을 수정했는지 추가 해야한다. 그리고 원래의 소스를 라이브러리나 API 형식으로 사용하는 경우 본래의 소스는 Apache License를 유지해야 하지만 새로운 소스는 원하는 License를 골라 선택할 수 있다.</p>
                    <br><br>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Explain</h2>

                    <p>GPL License와 가장 큰 차이는 modified version에 대해 강제성이 없다는 것이다. GPL License는 파생된 모든 소스 코드를 GPL License를 적용하도록 강제를 하지만, Apache License는 본래의 코드만 Apache License를 유지하면 되고, 새로운 코드는 자신이 라이선스를 선택할 수 있다.</p><br>

                    <p>GPL License v2와는 섞어서 라이선스를 쓰지 못하지만 GPL License v3는 Apache License와 섞어서 쓸 수 있다.</p><br>

                    <p>Apache License를 채택한 소프트웨어는 자유롭게 판매가 가능하지만 Apache Foundation에서 만들었다거나 Apache Mark를 사용해서는 절대로 안 된다.</p>
                    <br><br>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Applying</h2>

                    <p>라이선스 적용 방법은 프로젝트 폴더의 가장 상위 폴더에 LICENSE 파일이나 COPYING 파일에다가 Apache License 원문을 삽입하면 된다. Github에서도 이것을 인식해서 라이선스를 명시해 준다.</p>

                    direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
                    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the
